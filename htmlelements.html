<h2>Edit Photographs To Look Deliciousüòã</h2> 

I used Adobe Photoshop to color correct, sharpen, and modify these images after I imported 
them into Adobe Lightroom. Adobe Photoshop allows for more granular control when it comes 
to editing photos. The ability to use layers for unique adjustments is key when producing 
imagery like this.

<h2>Create A Logo For A New Brand</h2>  

Photoshop is a great tool for working and creating logos. It helps to get all of your ideas
 down on paper. Being able to organize your layers into groups is wonderful. Also, adding and 
 modifying text is made easy in Photoshop with the character panel.

<h2>Present Website Designs</h2>

After I create designs for a new website in something like Adobe Xd, I will always bring my 
exported slides into photoshop to begin organizing my client presentations. This is where Photoshop 
is really useful as it allows you to work seamlessly with other Adobe programs.

<h2>Create Realistic Packaging Examples</h2>

Photoshop is a powerhouse when it comes to creating realistic packaging and mockups for your projects. 
This really helps when working with clients to help them understand the idea you have in mind.

<h2>Develop A Mobile App</h2>

As a designer I have been able to work on a number of mobile apps and have used Photoshop a lot during 
the process. This is another example of how Photoshop can work well with other Adobe programs
 to create work that really makes an impact.

 <h2> Make Cool Posters</h2>

Combining imagery and text is exactly what Photoshop is all about. In this example I was able to edit 
the image to get the color right. Crop the image to focus in on the subject and then add text that would 
compliment the objective of the poster.

<h2>Interior Design Of A Football Stadium</h2>

You can use Adobe Photoshop for interior design! I helped create designs for a fantasy football lounge 
in a football stadium using Photoshop. Photoshop helped me concept and present my ideas for the various 
applications inside the lounge.

<h2>Present An Amazon Alexa Skill</h2>

Working on something like Amazon Alexa where there isn‚Äôt a lot of visual materials to create is fun.
 I used Adobe Photoshop to create slides and infographics to present a voice skill and statistics of how 
 voice enabled devices are projected to grow in the future.

<h2>Create Artwork With My Favorite Cartoons</h2>

This was one of my favorite projects because I used Photoshop to concept the artwork around 
a mobile for my favorite childhood cartoon, Transformers!

<h2>Is Learning Photoshop Worth It?</h2>

Learning how to use Adobe Photoshop can be very valuable to not only those who want to build a 
career in the creative industry but also for those who aren‚Äôt. As social media and creating content
 becomes such a big part of businesses, any experience with graphic applications like Adobe Photoshop
  will give you an advantage when applying to your next big job opportunity. When creative companies post 
  an open role within their team, they will almost always list experience with Adobe Photoshop as a requirement.
   Adobe Photoshop is very versatile and allows creatives to complete a wide variety of tasks with it.
    Adobe Photoshop can sometimes be the only program that a creative will ever need in their repertoire.
     Learning Photoshop can open up new opportunities in a number of fields. Once you have a solid understanding 
     of Photoshop, this will also put you in a great position to learn and use other Adobe programs. Some tools and
      shortcuts are very similar throughout all of the Adobe programs. Teaching yourself to use other Adobe programs 
      outside of Photoshop will allow you to sharpen your skills and open your artwork up to creating something unique.

<h2> Is Adobe Photoshop Free?</h2>

Unfortunately Adobe Photoshop is not free and requires you to pay for a subscription to use it. However you 
can try Adobe Photoshop free for 7 days before paying for a full subscription to ensure it is right for you. 
To get started using Adobe Photoshop you will have to register and sign up for an Adobe Creative Cloud account.
 Using that link to create an Adobe Creative Cloud will give you a free 7-day trial to test out Photoshop as well as 
 a bunch of other really awesome Adobe programs. Once your 7-day trial is up you will have to choose a Creative Cloud plan
  to continue using the Adobe software.
